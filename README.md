This repository provides the data and implementations of the methods described in [PAV](TODO: Add arxiv link)

# Usage 

The file **PAV.md** contains a function **PAVedr** to select a tuning parameter within a set of tuning parameters for ridge regression that minimizes the prediction error for individual covariate. The aforementioned paper contains detailed descriptions of these methods.


# Simulations

We provide an example code in **SimulationStudy.md** for a comparison of averaged individual prediction errors with 10-fold cross-validation. This program requires R 3.4.4 or earlier.

# Real Data Analyses

**Kidney Transplant Data Analysis**
